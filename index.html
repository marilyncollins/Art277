        <h1>Travelling in Depression</h1>
        <p>When I was very little, I caught the travel bug. It started after my grandparents first brought 
            me to their home in France and I have now been to twenty-nine different countries. 
            Each has given me a unique learning experience.
        </p>
        <p>At five, I marveled at the Eiffel Tower in the City of Lights. When I was eight, I stood in the 
            heart of Piazza San Marco feeding hordes of pigeons, then glided down Venetian waterways 
            on sleek gondolas. At thirteen, I saw the ancient, megalithic structure of Stonehenge and 
            walked along the Great Wall of China, amazed that the thousand-year-old stones were still in place.
            </p>
            <div class="square">

            <div>
            <p>It was through exploring cultures around the world that I first became interested in language.
            It began with French, which taught me the importance of 
            pronunciation. I remember once asking a store owner in Paris 
            where Rue des Pyramides was. But when I pronounced it 
            PYR–a–mides instead of pyr–A–mides, with more accent on 
            the A, she looked at me bewildered.</P>
            <p>In the eighth grade, I became fascinated with Spanish and 
            aware of its similarities with English through cognates. 
            Baseball in Spanish, for example, is béisbol, which looks 
            different but sounds nearly the same. This was incredible to 
            me as it made speech and comprehension more fluid, and even today I find that cognates 
            come to the rescue when I forget how to say something in Spanish.</p>
            <p>Then, in high school, I developed an enthusiasm for Chinese. As I studied Chinese at my 
            school, I marveled how if just one stroke was missing from a character, the meaning is lost. I 
            loved how long words were formed by combining simpler characters, so Huǒ (火) meaning 
            fire and Shān (山) meaning mountain can be joined to create Huǒshān (火山), which means 
            volcano. I love spending hours at a time practicing the characters and I can feel the beauty 
            and rhythm as I form them.
